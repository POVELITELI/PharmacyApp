# PharmacyApp
C# appp, databse, login form
I created a pharmacy-type application, which can be used by 2 types of users: administrators and pharmacists.

admins can manipulate user data: add, modify, delete and view.

pharmacists can view medical products, add, delete and sell products.

all the information is stored in the pharmacy.sql file

PS: I haven't finished the PURCHASE AND PRINT button
